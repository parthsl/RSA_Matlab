1.) To Generate public-private key pairs from random numbers, run rsa_keygeneration gunction.
    It will give output [d,e,n] where d->private key, e->public key, n->p*q.
2.) To encrypt/decrypt any text from 'input.txt' file, run rsa.m file directly and will give proper console input and output process.
    Also Graph of plain Text VS cipher Text will be plotted.
3.) To perform authentication using Digital Signature, run rsa_Signature.m file directly and will produce Signature of text from input.txt file.
